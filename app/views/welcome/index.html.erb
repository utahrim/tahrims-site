      Hi there!
      My name is Tahrim Uddin and I am a full stack web developer. Late in my college years I discovered a great passion for coding and decided that this is what I want to do for a living. Since I was only a few credits away from graduating with a Bachelor's degree in Biology, I decided to finish school and pursue coding . After graduating I moved to New York City to attend DevBootcamp, an intensive 18-24 week coding bootcamp, in hopes of becoming a full stack web developer. I graduated at the end on November 2015 and now I reside in West Palm Beach, Florida. I am currently seeking a new opportunity to be part of a team that have a drive to help people and build new, innovative and meaningful things.
